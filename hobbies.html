<p>I am learning to code as a hobby, as it facinates me on how the websites/apps work and do what we command them to do.
  In the future I will also be learning new skills as technology is advancing very quicky with introduction to Machine Learning, AI etc.
  Hopefully, I won't give up on this Jounrney and if i am successfull, will be able to develop a better project in the future.
  I will be developing my first project soon with just HMTL and CSS and this page will be linked to that project on "About Me."

<p>I also like to play Football and Cricket</p>
<p>I do love watching movies alongslide Travelling.</p>
